/*  QUESTION 1---
Object-oriented programming System(OOPs) is a programming concept that is based on “objects”.
OOPs is a programming approach or a technique in which certain concepts are given to create a program in any certain language.
 Any language that follows or implements the concepts of OOPs can be called Object Oriented Programing Language.
OOPs concepts are just a description or a theory to create a program of any programming language.

P= Polymorphism
A=Abstraction
I=Inharitance
E=Encapsulation

In procedural programming, the program is divided into small parts called functions. 
In object-oriented programming, the program is divided into small parts called objects.
 Procedural programming follows a top-down approach.
  Object-oriented programming follows a bottom-up approach.

QUESTION-2

In Java, classes and objects are basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)
 that are used to represent real-world  entities. 
 The class represents a group of objects having similar properties and behavior. For example, 
the animal type Dog is a class while a particular dog named Tommy is an object of the Dog class.

class is the type of blueprint 
if does not acquire any memory space.

while the object acquire memory space in the system.

//Program for class

class Student {
    
    int id;
    String name;

    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        
        Student s1 = new Student();
        System.out.println(s1.id);
        System.out.println(s1.name);
    }
}

 QUESTION-3

  There are four main principles of object-oriented programming. 
  
  Encapsulation
  Abstraction
  Inheritance 
  Polymorphism

  1// ENCAPSULATION--


  It is used to hide the complete mechanism of how the implementation is taking place.
   It helps to secure our data by protecting it from direct access by unauthorised entities.
   It uses access specifiers to protect the internal state of our objects from outside entities. 

   There are three major types of access specifiers which help to control the access of data.
    These are public, private and protected specifiers.


  2// ABSTRACTION-- 
Abstraction is used to simplify the complex working of a class or method by hiding unnecessary details
 and only highlighting the important details at the forefront.
 It helps users to interact with the system properly without worrying about how everything is working here.


 3// INHERITENCE--
 Inheritance is one of the most important concepts in object oriented programming. 
 It helps us to use the features and properties of an existing class in another class. 
 The child class can use the features of the parent class. It promotes code re-usability.

 ** FOR INHERETING THE PROPERTIES OF SUPER CLASS IN SUB CLASS WE WILL USE THE " extends " KEYWORD.


 4// POLYMORPHISM--
 Polymorphism in oops is one of the most important concepts in Object-oriented programming. 
 It is a method in OOPS that tells that a class or entity occurs in different forms. 
 ‘Poly’ means many, and ‘morphism’ means forms. Hence, polymorphism means to exist in many forms.

 There are two types of Polymorphism: 
 1--Compile-time polymorphism 
 2--Runtime polymorphism. 

>>>Compile Time Polymorphism: 
The compile time polymorphism in Oops is achieved by using method overloading.
 When more than one function has the same name but different parameters, it is called method overloading.

>>>Runtime polymorphism: 
Runtime polymorphism uses method overriding to achieve polymorphism.
 The method call here is used at the runtime.
  The method overriding is used in the subclass is already defined in
   its superclass which is executed at the runtime. 
  for rxample;;
 A class Animal has a method sound () which can be called either for dog or a cat depending upon the call.

  QUESTION-4

  INHERITENSE IN JAVA:
  Inheritance is one of the most important concepts in object oriented programming. 
 It helps us to use the features and properties of an existing class in another class. 
 The child class can use the features of the parent class. It promotes code re-usability.

NEED OF INHERITENSE--
>> IT PROMOTES CODE REUSABILITY.
>> CAN INHERIT OR REUSE THE PROPERTIES OF SUPERCLASS IN SUBCLASS.
